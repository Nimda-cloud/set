# NIMDA System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sound Alert System Legacy Code
**Problem**: Old `AlertType` and `trigger_alert` references were causing runtime errors.

**Solution**: 
- Removed all legacy `AlertType` references from `sound_alerts_enhanced.py`
- Removed `trigger_alert` method calls
- Updated functions to use new `play_threat_alert` method
- Cleaned up `emergency_alert` and `stop_emergency` functions

**Files Modified**:
- `sound_alerts_enhanced.py` - Removed legacy code

### 2. Status Bar Attribute Error
**Problem**: `switch_ai_language` method was trying to access `self.status_bar` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**:
- Changed all `self.status_bar` references to `self.status_label`
- Added `hasattr()` checks to prevent AttributeError
- Updated all status update methods

**Files Modified**:
- `nimda_tkinter.py` - Fixed status bar references

### 3. Threading Issues
**Problem**: "main thread is not in main loop" errors during security updates.

**Solution**:
- Added proper thread safety checks
- Used `self.root.after(0, lambda: ...)` for UI updates from background threads
- Improved error handling in monitoring threads

## Test Results
